# React Practice

Today, we're going to consolidate everything we've done in React so far. You can choose from the following mini-projects.

## Calculator

Build a simple calculator, which can multiply, divide, add and subract two numbers inputed by the user. Display the calcucation and the answer.

Choose this project if you want to practice:

- Components, state (`useState`), props and `useEffect`
- Logic
- Controlled form components

As an extention, you could:

- Allow the user to use more operators (squared, square roots, percent, etc)
- Create a π button (or allow it to be inputed) so the user can use π in their calculations
- Display the calculation as it's being typed

## Hacker News Client

Build a filterable front-end for [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). Using the following endpoints, allow the user to view a list of top stories, and filter them by title.

- https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json - Latest Stories
- https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{storyId}.json - Story Detail

Choose this project if you want to practice:

- Components, state (`useState`), props and `useEffect`.
- Working with requests
- Working with forms

_*Hint:*_ How can you send multiple requests and wait for responses? Research [Promise.all](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all).

## Metronome

You have been asked to create a [metronome](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=metronome&oq=metronome&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1319j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), much like the one that Google provides. Start with a range slider, play and stop buttons.

Choose this project if you want to practice:

- Components, state (`useState`), props and `useEffect`.
- Working with intervals
- Working with sound
- Researching topics you're not familiar with

As an extension, you could:

- Allow the user to select different sounds from a list.

_*Hint:*_ You might want to research the [range](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range) input type, [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval), [clearInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/clearInterval), and [making sound with JavaScript](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23395136/22946).
