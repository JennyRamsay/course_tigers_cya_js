**Potential Icebreaker games**

### While introducing yourself answer one of the following:
* What would you do if you won the lottery?
* If you could be anyone else for a day, who would it be?
* What superpower would you want and why?

### Two truths, and a lie
* Once gathered, have everyone come up with two things that are true about themselves and another thing that's false. Then have each person present what they came up with.
Everyone tries to guess the right answer.

### The one-word icebreaker game
* Break the students into small groups of four or five people. Ask them a very simple question—e.g., "What one word would you use to describe how we feel about starting the course"—and give each team five or 10 minutes to come up with their answers.
* Then it's time to ask each team to share their answers with the rest of the group. 


## Create the classroom culture
* Break the students into small groups of four or five people. Ask them a very to come up with classroom rules that will build a safe classroom culture.
