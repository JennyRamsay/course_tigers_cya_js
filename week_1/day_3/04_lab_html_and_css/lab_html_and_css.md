# Lab: HTML & CSS

**Learning Objectives**

- Be able to use semantic HTML
- Be able to use aesthetic CSS properties
- Be able to use CSS Flex
- Be able to use CSS Grid
- Be able to use Chrome Dev Tools to debug HTML & CSS

## Brief

In this lab you will build a webpage using the skills that you have gained over the past few days. The content of the webpage isn't important (choose a theme that interests you!) but it must contain:

- semantically correct HTML
- styling using aesthetic CSS properties
- an instance of CSS Flex
- an instance of CSS Grid

You can add navigation links etc. (even if they don't go anywhere) to make it feel a bit more like a real website but it only has to be a single page. Most importantly, have fun, explore and experiment. Don't be afraid to try new things or break the webpage. Your text editor has a handy "undo" feature that can be used when things go wrong!

## Planning

You might start by considering the layout of the page. What do you want the overall shape of website to look like? It might help to draw this out on a sheet of paper or using a drawing tool like http://app.ziteboard.com. It doesn't have to be pretty, it just has to help you figure out what you want to build and how you're going to build it.

Once you have drawn out a rough design, begin to think about how you will build it. How will the styling of each area be applied? Should this be a grid, flex or neither? Once you have a general idea in your head about how you will approach the problem, it might be time to put fingers to keys and start building.

## Considerations

If you add a style rule to an element and it doesn't have the effect that you expected, remember that you can use the Chrome Dev Tools to inspect HTML elements and check the style rules that are being applied to them.

It could be that you have not correctly selected the element, so the style rules are not being applied. It could be that the property that you're affecting doesn't do exactly what you think it does. Or it might be the case that the style rules are being overriden by other style rules.

Remember that Google is your friend. If you get stuck, ask the internet first. There's a lot of helpful advice out there and the ability to find it is one of the most important skills that a developer can develop! If you can't find the answers that you need, ask an instructor. They will be happy to help.
